I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, focusing on comparative politics, gender, and the political economy of development. I am also a Resident Research Associate at the [Center on the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/). My research explores the long-term effects of conflict and social movements on gender dynamics in Latin America, focusing on Mexico, Cuba, and Central America. In my dissertation, I examine the determinants of gender inequality in post-WWII revolutionary contexts. My work applies mixed causal inference and machine learning methods that employ large-scale administrative, survey, and archival data.

Prior to Berkeley, I worked for the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles and as an Advisor to Mexico's Undersecretary for North America in Mexico City. I also worked as Program Manager for a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization that educates local Latinx elected officials on water and sustainability issues. I have worked as a consultant on issues around gender violence and migration for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the World Bank via the Berkeley Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), and others. I hold a Master's Degree in Applied Development Economics from the London School of Economics and a Bachelor's in International Relations and the Global Economy from the University of Southern California.

I was born in Mexico City and immigrated to Los Angeles, CA, with my family when I was 12. I am a proud first-generation college graduate.
