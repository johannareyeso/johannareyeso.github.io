I am a PhD Student in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley focusing on comparative politics and international development. My research explores gender dynamics of development and migration. I am interested in the ways in which economic shocks generated by regime change and  mass social phenomena (such as migration patterns or revolutions) can lead to more equitable policies that favor vulnerable populations in the long run. 

Prior to Berkeley, I worked for the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the Consulate General of Mexico in Los Angeles, and as Advisor for the Ministry's Undersecretary for North America. I also worked as Program Manager for a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization that educates local Latinx elected officials on water and sustainability issues. I hold a Master's Degree in Applied Development Economics from the London School of Economics and a Bachelor's Degree in International Relations and the Global Economy from the University of Southern California.

I was born in Mexico City and immigrated to Los Angeles, CA with my family when I was 12 years old.
