Do protests against violence toward women help reduce it, or do they exacerbate it? Over the past 20
years, mass demonstrations with feminist causes have dramatically increased across the region. These
movements have advocated for critical legislative changes, including the legalization of abortion and the
recognition of femicide as a distinct criminal offense. But how effective are these protests? We analyze
their impact both on legislation and on (actual) violence against women. Using an instrumental variable,
we provide the first cross-country evaluation of the effects of protest agenda-seeding on femicide and
whether these protests directly influence legislation criminalizing violence against women. This research
contributes to the growing body of literature on gendered social movements and policy change, offering
insights into how grassroots activism can influence both legal frameworks and societal behavior.
