Dissertation project.

What explains the variation in gender inequality exhibited across countries that experienced a social revolution? Political science scholars have said little about the reasons why some groups are favored over others--or about the durability of inclusionary projects and reforms--in revolutionary movements. My research explores why and when women are included or excluded from revolutionary projects by studying Cuban leaders' decision-making process around women's property and political rights. My dissertation project presents a review on the current theoretical and methodological debates around this question and proposes a new theoretical argument.
