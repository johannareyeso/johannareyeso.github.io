Dissertation project.

What explains the variation in gender inequality exhibited across countries that experienced a social revolution? Political science scholars have said little about why some groups are favored over others---or about the durability of inclusionary projects and reforms---in revolutionary contexts. My research explores why and when women are included or excluded from revolutionary projects by tracing revolutionary leaders' decision-making process around women's political, economic, and physical integrity rights. My dissertation presents the first empirical test of the relationship between social revolutions and women's incorporation. I demonstrate that not all revolutions lead to improved outcomes for women, but those with socialist aims account for much of the positive effect. By delving into socialist cases through a comparative historical analysis of two pairs of social revolutions and using Cuba as the primary theory-building case, I identify three conditions conducive to women's enfranchisement. I argue that understanding the initial commitments of revolutionary elites is vital to comprehending the path-dependent trajectory of gender inequality across post-revolutionary societies.
