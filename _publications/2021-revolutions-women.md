Little has been said by political science scholars about the reasons why some groups are favored over others in the aftermath of revolutions. This paper aims at explaining why and when women are included or excluded from state transitions, and more specifically evaluate why revolutionary or transition leaders target gender inequality via two key channels: property rights and political citizenship. It presents a review on the current theoretical and methodological debates around this question and proposes a new theoretical argument.
