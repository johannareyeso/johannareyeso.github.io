Data collection in progress. 

How do specialized women's courts/or specialized clinics impact the incidence of sexual violence against women and girls? In 2008, the Guatemalan government passed a Decree demanding the creation of Specialized Courts for the investigation of violence against women and girls. These courts are divided into Specialized Courts for adults and Children's Courts for minors. As of 2019, only 13 out of the stipulated 22 courts had been opened (Koch et al. 2020). Similarly, in 2019, the Public Health Ministry implemented a Protocol of Attention to victims of sexual violence that implemented a network Specialized Clinics. As of 2020, these clinics were located in 38 national or regional hospitals (ibid.). Leveraging the as-if-random assignment of the specialized clinics and courts throughout the country, I perform a difference-in-means analysis comparing districts where specialized courts/clinics exist to those where they do not.
