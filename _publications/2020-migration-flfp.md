title: "The Gendered Process of Migration: Labour-Market Behaviour of Left-Behind Wives in Mexico"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2020-migration-flfp
excerpt: 'This paper explores the effect of male emigration from Mexico on women's labour-market behaviour. It borrows from existing gender, labour-market, and migration literature and uses nonlongitudinal data extracted via an ethnosurvey approach by the Mexican Migration Project (MMP). The results show that Mexican women's labour-market behavior may face normative constraints that limit their ability to undertake paid work. This is exacerbated by living in a household where the main provider is a migrant and whose absence results in an increased burden of unpaid domestic labor on his non-migrant spouse. This study contributes to a growing line of research suggesting that women's economic choices in developing countries can be shaped by gender norms rather than by economic or institutional characteristics alone.'
